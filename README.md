## 🚀 Live Demo & Login Guide

This is a **web-based Uber-style ride booking platform** where users can request rides and captains (drivers) can accept and complete them.  
The site works best in **mobile view** for a realistic app-like experience.

### 📱 How to Try the App
1. Open the live site: **[Uber Clone Live](https://uber-ruby-beta.vercel.app/)**
2. If you are on a desktop, switch your browser to **mobile view** (right-click → Inspect → Toggle Device Toolbar).
3. Log in with the credentials for either **User** or **Captain** (delivery driver).
4. Open **two browser tabs** (or devices) — one logged in as the User and one as the Captain.
5. Visit these routes to see live communication between them:
   - **User view**: [https://uber-ruby-beta.vercel.app/home](https://uber-ruby-beta.vercel.app/home)
   - **Captain view**: [https://uber-ruby-beta.vercel.app/caption-home](https://uber-ruby-beta.vercel.app/caption-home)
